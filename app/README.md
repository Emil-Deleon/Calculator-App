OVERVIEW
    Hello and welcome to my Calculator App! This project was designed to showcase my understanding
    of a second language that'd id be exposed to during my Apprenticeship at Clover. I had allot 
    of fun(headaches) while creating this app, and Im very proud of the result!
    
    My calculator app can can Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide Whole Numbers and Decimal Numbers 
    quickly and correctly. The calculator also has a backspace function, which lets you delete the 
    most recent character selected. The app also has an AC (all clear) button that clears every
    character that has been typed before. Both the Frontend And Backend were created from scratch.

ANDROID STUDIO WALK-THROUGH
    In order to see and use my project, you'll have to download and run an emulator within 
    Android Studio, below are step by step instructions on how to do so.

    AVD CREATION
    Each instance of the Android Emulator uses an Android virtual device (AVD) to specify the 
    Android version and hardware characteristics of the simulated device. To effectively test your
    app, create an AVD that models each device your app is designed to run on. 

    * From the Android Studio Welcome screen, select More Actions > Virtual Device Manager.

    * After opening a project, select View > Tool Windows > Device Manager from the main menu bar, 
    and then click Create device.
    

    RUNNING APP ON THE EMULATOR
    After you have created an AVD, you can start the Android Emulator and run app.

    * In the toolbar, select the AVD that you want to run your app on from the target device menu.

    * Select Pixel 2 API 30 to download.

    * Click Run. The emulator might take a minute or so to launch for the first time, but 
    subsequent launches use a snapshot and should launch faster. 

    Once your app is installed on your AVD, you can run it from the device as you would run any 
    app on a device. Any time you want to deploy new changes, you need to click Run or 
    Apply Changes again.
